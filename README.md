# PopDataViz2017

This repository contains six datasets that you are welcome to use for the PopDataViz Hackathon! We aimed to provide two of each related to health/epidemiology, sociology/demography, and economics. For each topic area, a smaller dataset for beginners, and an advanced dataset for those more comfortable in R, are provided.

Please see Import-Data.md for a description of the datasets and information for how to load the dataset you would like to visualize. If you would like, you can append more information to your chosen dataset as you see fit. For example, you could add province/state/country-level information to the dataset if you would like your visualization to reflect these added characteristics. To do so, search online for additional information and merge it to your dataset of choice. If you need help with merging the data, please let us know. 

Have fun and experiment with your visualization. We are here to help, and can also show you good practices for helping yourself using R's search tools and online resources like Stack Overflow. 

Bon Hackathon!
